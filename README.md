# Lip Reading System

## Overview

The Lip Reading System is a deep learning-based project that leverages TensorFlow to recognize spoken words by analyzing lip movements. This system is designed to transcribe spoken words from video input by understanding the visual patterns of mouth movements.

## Features

- **Deep Learning Model:** Utilizes TensorFlow to build and train a neural network for lip reading.
- **Video Input:** Processes video files to extract and analyze lip movements.
- **Transcription:** Converts visual lip movements into text.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* TensorFlow 2.x
* Keras 2.x
* OpenCV 4.x
* Numpy 1.x
